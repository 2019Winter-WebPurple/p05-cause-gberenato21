            <h3>About the Polar Bear</h3>
            <p>Polar Bears, classified as marine mammals, spend most of their lives hunting for their main source of food, seals, around the Arctic Sea. They live on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean and rely on their climate to secure their habitat (ice). Polar bears have a water-repellant coat which keeps them warm in the frigid temperatures. They can even swim up to six miles per hour by paddling with their front paws.</p>

            <h3>Why the Polar Bear Population Has Decreased</h3>
            <p>Ongoing loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate change has forced polar bears into being listed under the Endangered Species Act in May of 2008. Another threat includes polar bear-human conflicts; polar bears are forced onto the shore due to climate change and often encounter coastal communities and others working in the Arctic. Sadly, these interactions can end badly for both humans and polar bears. There are also industrial impacts which are leading to the decrease in the polar bear population. Polar bears can come into contact with spilled oil (which is fatal) and oil spilled in one part of the ocean will <b>not</b> remain there and will have devastating effects. Oil spills also effect the entire food chain. Finally, unsustainable hunting has been another reason for the disappearance of polar bears. In many areas of the Arctic, there is a strong enforcement of polar bear management and monitoring. However, there are some places where unsustainable hunting seems to be taking place, which includes unreported and illegal hunting of polar bears.</p>

        <h3 id="nofloat">Why Polar Bears Are Important</h3>
        <p>Since polar bears are at the top of the food chain, they have an important role in the overall health and wellness of marine life. Through thousands of years, polar bears have been a key part in the lives, culture, and economy of Arctic people. Polar bears rely on sea ice, therefore, their existence is directly impacted by climate change, serving as an important indicator species.</p>
